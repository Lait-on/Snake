# Snake Game - Terminal Version (C)

This project implements the classic Snake game in C, with the game running in the terminal. The player controls the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into walls or itself.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to:
1. Implement the Snake game logic using the C programming language.
2. Display the game on the terminal using ASCII characters.
3. Handle user input for controlling the snake's movement.
4. Manage game over conditions, including collisions with the walls and the snakeâ€™s own body.

## Features

- **Terminal-based display**: The game is displayed using ASCII characters in the terminal.
- **Snake movement**: The player can control the snake using the arrow keys.
- **Food spawning**: The game randomly spawns food on the screen, and the snake grows longer each time it eats.
- **Collision detection**: The game detects collisions with walls and the snake itself, ending the game if either occurs.
- **Score tracking**: The game displays the current score, which is the length of the snake.

## Prerequisites

- **Language**: C
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang.
- **Libraries**: ncurses (Linux/macOS) or Windows Console API (for Windows).
